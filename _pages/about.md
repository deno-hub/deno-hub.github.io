I am a PhD candidate in Agricultural Economics at Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin, affiliated with the IRI THESys Graduate Program and the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF). My research focuses on structural inequality, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and intersectional vulnerabilities among smallholder farmers in Kenya.

My current work integrates **econometrics, machine learning, and psychometric models** to explore how gender, agroecology, and institutional constraints shape outcomes in yield, food security, and CSA adoption. I have developed novel frameworks using **Bayesian networks, Rasch modeling, Ising models, and regression discontinuity designs** to evaluate complex adaptation systems.

Recently, Iâ€™ve grown increasingly passionate about **computational modeling and data-driven approaches** in agri-food systems. Iâ€™m exploring how methods from network science, spatial risk modeling, and ensemble machine learning can be used to better capture feedbacks, tipping points, and trade-offs in agricultural transformation.

This interdisciplinary orientation reflects my commitment to bridging rigorous empirical research with actionable insights for climate resilience, gender equity, and sustainable rural development.
