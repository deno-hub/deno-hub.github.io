## Profile Summary

I am a Kenyan national and PhD candidate in Agricultural Economics at Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin, working with the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF). My research integrates multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary approaches to address inequality, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), food systems transformation, and rural livelihoods in the Global South. With a growing passion for **computational modeling and data-driven approaches** in agri-food systems, I combine econometrics, network science, and machine learning to address sustainability challenges.

My academic and professional ambitions are grounded in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to food security, climate resilience, and gender equity. I aspire to develop innovative and rigorous policy-relevant research that combines systems thinking with spatial and statistical methods such as GIS, AEO/RS, and Bayesian models to better understand agroecological and socioeconomic vulnerabilities.
