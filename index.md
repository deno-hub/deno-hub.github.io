I am a PhD candidate in Agricultural Economics at Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin, affiliated with the IRI THESys Graduate Program and the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF). My research focuses on structural inequality, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and intersectional vulnerabilities among smallholder farmers in Kenya.

My current work integrates econometrics, machine learning, and psychometric models to explore how gender, agroecology, and institutional constraints shape outcomes in yield, food security, and CSA adoption. I have developed novel frameworks using Bayesian networks, Rasch modeling, Ising models, and regression discontinuity designs to evaluate complex adaptation systems.

Recently, Iâ€™ve grown increasingly passionate about computational modeling and data-driven approaches in agri-food systems. Iâ€™m exploring how methods from network science, spatial risk modeling, and ensemble machine learning can be used to better capture feedbacks, tipping points, and trade-offs in agricultural transformation.

This interdisciplinary orientation reflects my commitment to bridging rigorous empirical research with actionable insights for climate resilience, gender equity, and sustainable rural development.
